K94Keeps, NFP belives that bringing a dog into your family should be forever. We are a 100% volunteer run, 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to dog rescue.<br><br>

We believe rescue should begin with education and community involvement. We strive to place dogs in homes that will provide a safe, loving environment. We work with adopters throughout the adoption process to promote a positive, forever relationship.<br><br>

K94Keeps rescues dogs from open-access shelters in Chicago and the surrounding areas. We sometimes have owners who surrender their dogs directly to us as well. All dogs are provided housing, vetting, foster, and adoption services.<br><br>

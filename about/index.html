K9 4 KEEPS, NFP believes that bringing a dog into your family should be forever. For keeps. We are a 100% volunteer run, 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to dog rescue. We believe rescue should begin with education and counseling of dog owners regarding proper handling and training of their dogs to support positive, forever relationships. K9 4 KEEPS dogs are surrendered by their owners or rescued from Chicagoland area kill shelters and are provided vetting, housing, foster and adoption services.

<h2>History</h2>

The seeds of K9 4 KEEPS, NFP were planted way back in 2000 when Amy and Daniel adopted their first dog, Otto. He was a 10 month old, 90 lb. Rottweiler. Otto was adopted from a local rescue and was followed by a couple of foster dogs including Maximus, another Rottie and their first “foster‐failure.” Amy and Daniel became inspired by Otto and Max to start <a href="http://www.barkavenueplaycare.com/">Bark Avenue Playcare, Inc</a> and also get more involved with dog (and the occasional cat) rescue. 

Like most people in the rescue world, they helped a few different organizations and met a lot of truly dedicated people. Bark Avenue became a rescue resource early on with the first employees being hired to care for some of these organization’s rescue dogs which were in boarding. Amy and Daniel started to see the actual scope of the homeless/abused/neglected animal situation in Chicago. Through their involvement with friends and contacts in the “dog world”, they realized that more could be done if they could create a network of people who shared their goals of responsible rescue and ownership. 

K9 4 KEEPS, NFP was born from the hope that we could make an impact on the homeless/abused/neglected dog problems in the Chicago area and empower more people to make a difference. K9 4 KEEPS, NFP was founded by Amy and Daniel with the help of the rest of our original Board members. The current Board has continued the original mission to impact the homeless/abused/neglected dog population of the Chicago area and empower people to make a difference.

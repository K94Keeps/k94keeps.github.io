K9 4 KEEPS, NFP believes that bringing a dog into your family should be forever. For keeps. We are a 100% volunteer run, 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to dog rescue. We believe rescue should begin with education and counseling of dog owners regarding proper handling and training of their dogs to support positive, forever relationships. K9 4 KEEPS dogs are surrendered by their owners or rescued from Chicagoland area kill shelters and are provided vetting, housing, foster and adoption services.

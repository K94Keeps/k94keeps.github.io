You can earn money for K9 4 KEEPS just by walking around! Whether you're...

 * Playing Pokemon Go
 * Walking your dog
 * Just walking (like going to the store)

Every mile you walk, “Walk for a Dog” (wooftrax.com) will donate to K9 4 KEEPS. Donations range from 11 cents to 25 cents per mile depending on the number of walkers for an organization. The more people walking the more they donate!  

What if I don’t have a dog? No problem!! You can still walk for dogs by choosing the “Walk for Cassie” option after enrolling in the app for the first time. Or, create your dream dog as a walking companion by going to the setup tab and adding a dog. So every walk you take whether you have a dog or not, can benefit us!

It’s simple and free! All you do is walk.

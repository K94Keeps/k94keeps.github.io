We want you to adopt a pet who can enjoy a lifetime of love with you, so we take special measures to ensure that your potential future pet is the best match for you and your family. We have set up the following procedures for anyone wishing to foster and/or adopt one of our dogs.

## Requirements

To be considered for fostering and/or adopting a K9 4 KEEPS dog, you must:

 * be at least 21 years of age
 * have a form of photo identification (license or state ID) that shows your current address
 * live within 60 miles of Chicago (or have made special arrangements with K9 4 KEEPS to adopt a dog into a home outside this 60-mile radius)
 * be able to show proof that you are allowed to have a pet of the breed and size you wish to adopt in the place where you currently live
 * be able to spend the time and resources necessary to provide the training, medical treatment and proper care for your pet

## Procedure

Start by filling out the application below. If you'd like to foster, there's a separate [foster application](/volunteer/foster-application).

 * understand that the completion of this application does not guarantee the foster or adoption of a K9 4 KEEPS dog
 * know that the applicants that seem to be the best fit for each particular dog will be contacted by a K9 4 KEEPS volunteer by phone or email to set up an initial meeting
 * have all family members present (including any resident dogs or children) for the introduction of the dog
 * set up a time for a home visit

**If approved to foster a K9 4 KEEPS dog,** be prepared to:

 * sign a legally binding foster contract
 * spend up to an hour with a foster counselor to discuss the responsibility of fostering a dog

**If approved to adopt a K9 4 KEEPS dog,** be prepared to:

 * sign a legally binding adoption contract
 * pay an adoption fee of $300.00 on the date of adoption (this fee goes toward the rescue and care of current and future rescue dogs)
 * take the dog home on the date of adoption
 * spend up to an hour with an adoption counselor to discuss the responsibility of owning a dog and making your relationship with your dog a lifetime commitment

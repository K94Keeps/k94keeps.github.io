Baxter is a sweet, wiggly guy who loveeessss meeting new people. He is great with children as well-very gentle and friendly. Baxter does well with other dogs as long as he has some rules and structure (he can be a little bit of a bossy pants with other dogs!) but he's been curious and gentle with the cats in his foster home. Baxter would do well in just about any household!

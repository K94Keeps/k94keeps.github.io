Cora is the sweetest little girl. After being pulled from an open access shelter, Cora was hospitalized with a pretty serious case of pneumonia. She is on the mend and finally in her awesome foster home. Cora has a sweet and friendly tail wag for everyone she meets. She is in a foster home with two cats and does well with them. Cora is housebroken and lets you know when she needs to go outside. She would do well in just about any type of household. Cora is looking for a forever person or family who will give her love and affection in her golden years and lots of walks so she can strut down the street and show off her cuteness!

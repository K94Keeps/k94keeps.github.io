Sweet Brown Sugar was found as a stray next to her mate who had been hit and killed by a car. She was brought to CACC, and she was incredibly scared. Thanks to a team of people who fell in love with her, we were able to save her. She is absolutely the sweetest girl! She can be a little bit shy, but she wants nothing more than to trust. She will give you lots of kisses and snuggles and will happily let you pet her belly. We are excited to get to know this girl even more, but so far everyone at Roselle Animal Hospital loves her just as much as we do! We are currently looking for a foster home for Brown Sugar once she leaves ISO at the vet.

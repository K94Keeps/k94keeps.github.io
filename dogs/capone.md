CAPONE is worried-if-he-can’t-see-you LOYAL, jump-on-you-and-smother-you-with-kisses LOVING and is searching for a FOREVER HOME where he can have the chance to be someone’s BEST FRIEND. He needs to be the only pet in an adult-only home with someone who has experience with his breed(s). 

Capone got off to a “ruff” start to his life. He was rescued as a very sick puppy. He and his littler mate were living with somebody who couldn’t afford vet care for them. A friend of the family stepped in and and took them to Golf-Mil Veterinary Hospital. It turned out that both boys had parvo. Parvo is a horrible disease. Puppies with Parvo don’t usually survive. Golf-Mil treated them both then asked us if we could help find them their forever homes. Parvo treatment was tough on Capone. He almost didn’t make it. After a long struggle, fighting for his life, he pulled through.

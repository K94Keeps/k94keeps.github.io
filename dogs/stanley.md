Stanley is a 7-month old, 15 pound mix of cute, low-shedding white breeds! A coworker's mom took this dog in when his owner wanted to euthanize him for chewing the cable cord. Stanley is a sweet puppy who loves everyone he meets. Stay tuned for post-grooming pics this week! We think this cutie patootie will go quickly, so if you're interested please submit an application!

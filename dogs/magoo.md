Our sweet boy Magoo. He is very special to all of us. He was born blind and was the runt of his litter. Neither one of those things has stopped him from becoming the most loving little pup. He has caught up to his siblings physically, and he has been working on navigating the world with his foster mom and lots of training. Magoo would need to go to a very special home. This home should be a place where he can be guided, trained, and given confidence.

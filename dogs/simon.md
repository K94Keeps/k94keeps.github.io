Simon is a 13 week old mix breed dog who is all love. He is confident and funny and loves to play.

Simon was found as a stray and taken to an open access shelter. He is an amazing little ball of love who has incredible confidence and the biggest heart in his tiny little body. He is only about 3 months old, but he is a wise man. He is in a foster home with our Magoo, and they have become best buds.

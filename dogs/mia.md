Mia is the sweetest little peanut. She is currently recovering from a broken pelvis after likely being hit by a car. Despite being a little scared and in pain, Mia doesn't hold grudges. She has done well meeting a few dogs and is sweet to the kitties in her foster home. She is looking for a loving home!

Stone was brought to the local shelter because his family could no longer take care of him. He formerly lived with kids and a family.

He is an incredibly loving boy who is looking for some awesome humans who are willing to give him love and training. We love his big head, squishy lips, and super sweet personality.

Stone is extra special because he is deaf. Deaf dogs can lead perfectly normal lives, but they do need humans who are willing to train with them and work with their needs.

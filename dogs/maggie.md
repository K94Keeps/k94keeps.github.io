Maggie is our red-headed beauty queen! She has already captured the heart of her foster brother, Louie, who took one look at her and fell in love. She knows basic commands and is working on her manners since she is just nine months old, but she is a fast learner! Not only is Maggie beautiful, but she is smart! Maggie does have one weird habit. She likes to carry around a kitchen towel. So if you're willing to share your kitchen towels with this lady, we don't see any problems! Maggie would do best in a home with another dog or with a family that can give her lots of exercise and playtime. She will also need to be in a home with structure and continued training.

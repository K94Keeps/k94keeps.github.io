Oscar was found abandoned in an empty apartment by CPD on the West Side of Chicago, but we told him we would take it from here and find him a new, loving home! 

He is very sweet, takes treats nicely, and is eager to meet everyone. He loves to go on walks, give kisses, and he truly enjoys life. 

More info and photos to come. Please check back.

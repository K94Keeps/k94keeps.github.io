Layla is a 2 year old pittie mix who was being surrendered while we were in the lobby at animal control. She came in on a chain instead of a leash and collar. Her owners no longer can care for her. She is so friendly, confident, and happy. Layla is friendly with other dogs and lived in a home with children. She has the cutest ears that stand up in all kinds of adorable ways! 

More info and photos to come. Please check back.

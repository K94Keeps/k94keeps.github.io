Layla is a 2 year old pittie mix who was being surrendered while we were in the lobby at CACC. Her former "owners" brought her in on a chain instead of a leash and collar, so we knew we had to take her immediately! She is so friendly, confident, and happy. Layla is friendly with other dogs her size or bigger, and she lived in a home with children. She has the cutest ears that stand up in all kinds of adorable ways! 

From her foster: I am so impressed with Layla! She is a pro at "sit" and is getting the hang of "down." She is very smart and figures things out quickly. She is a super snuggler, waits patiently for me to take her outside, and is great with Moose. She is a total doll!

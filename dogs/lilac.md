Lilac can be pretty timid, but there is a reason. Police found her in her "owner's" home crammed in a small crate full of urine. They were told she was left in the cage because the "owner" was tired of hitting her because she didn't listen or behave. She was not allowed in the yard because she would find ways of escaping. This story doesn't even touch on the numerous prior offenses her "owner" had or his time spent in prison. We have a chance, as an animal loving community, to right the wrong done to this sweet girl.

Lilac recently had 7 puppies while she was in isolation at the vet. She and her puppies are still in boarding. All the puppies will need vaccinations and spay/neuter, which means extensive vet bills on top of the boarding costs. If you are able to donate, you can do so [directly on our website](/donate) or on her special [YouCaring page](https://www.youcaring.com/lilac-572695/update/477891).

Lilac is a Safe Humane dog, which means she comes with a lifetime of behavioral training support.

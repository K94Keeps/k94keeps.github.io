Freedom! K94Keeps is so excited to welcome Lilac to our family! She is such a wonderful girl who deserves to be healthy and find a happy, loving home! However, she is still recovering from the flu and will have extensive medical bills in the upcoming weeks, and we are trying to raise money to help her with medical bills and isolation boarding. She has already been through so much, and still has a long road ahead of her. We are doing everything to ensure that Lilac recovers quickly and finds her forever home. Please consider donating to Lilac! 

Lilac can be pretty timid, but there is a reason. Police found her in her "owner's" home crammed in a small crate full of urine. They were told she was left in the cage because the "owner" was tired of hitting her because she didn't listen or behave. She was not allowed in the yard because she would find ways of escaping. This story doesn't even touch on the numerous prior offenses her "owner" had or his time spent in prison. We have a chance, as an animal loving community, to right the wrong done to this sweet girl.

Lilac is a Safe Humane dog, which means she comes with a lifetime of behavioral training support. 

If you can donate to her medical care, you can donate [directly on our website](/donate) or on her special [YouCaring page](https://www.youcaring.com/lilac-572695/update/477891).

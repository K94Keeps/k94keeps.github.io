Lucy is the sweetest little baby seal faced lover girl. This little one was thrown out of a car on Lake Shore Drive, but thankfully was saved by a Chicago Police Officer, and we are so happy that she found her way to us at K94Keeps.

Lucy is currently in a foster home where she lives with a fur brother and a human foster mom who is working with Lucy to show her proper manners. She is very smart and loves to play, go on walks, and spend time at the local street fests, farmers markets, and outdoor patios.

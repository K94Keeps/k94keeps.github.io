Tequila was named after her foster mom's favorite drink, and we can't blame her! Tequila is a smart little nugget who already knows sit and down at just 12 weeks old. She's good with dogs AND cats, and LOVES people.

She is currently working on her potty training and crate training. She also lives with 3 other dogs who are showing her how to be part of a pack.

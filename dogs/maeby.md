This love was adopted about seven months ago, but unfortunately she has been brought back to us. We always stand by our dogs, so there wasn't a question about taking her back. However, we can't believe this nugget IS back. Beauty is about a year old now and looking for a foster or forever home. She's a tiny little lady with a coat of velvet. We can't tell you what to do, but you should definitely come meet this angel.

Baby Betsy was found as a stray running around Harlem and Irving Park Road. She is only about 9 months old, but we think she has already had babies! She still has baby teeth and a very friendly puppy personality despite the obvious abuse she has suffered. She has bite marks and burns on her, but that has not affected her sweet personality one bit! She is good with dogs of all sizes and sleeps with a cat every night. She is suffering from a little frostbite, but she will be all healed soon! She is a total lover and is looking for a forever home.

Xica (pronounced she-ka) is an amazingly energetic 10 year old lovely lady who is in need of a new home. She has been loved and well taken care of her entire life, but due to some changes, her current family needs to find her a new family to love her. She loves to play and run around in the yard. She is good with other dogs and kids and has the best personality.

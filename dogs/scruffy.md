Meet Scruffy! He is a 1-year old male Scraggle Rock mix (our best guess is Setter-Terrier). He is skin and bones but as sweet as can be. When he fills out he should be around 45 pounds. Scruffy was friendly and wiggly meeting another male dog. From what we've seen so far he would be a great family dog! This guy is all love. Please share him so he can find a wonderful forever home!

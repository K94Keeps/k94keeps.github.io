Nova is our sweet girl we pulled from Animal Welfare Leagueâ€™s southside intake facility. She was adopted but her owner is no longer able to care for her. Nova is looking for a forever home! 

Nova is sweet, sensitive, and cuddly! She had her tail amputated after we pulled her from the shelter so now she wags a cute little nub. Nova is social with other dogs. At daycare, she is often used to socialize new dogs! Nova is looking for an experienced owner that can continue her training. She is one of the most loving dogs you will ever have the pleasure of meeting!

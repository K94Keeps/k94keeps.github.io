Boss is a 108-pound male German Shepherd who is around 6 years old. Boss was found by one of our board members walking down the sidewalk with his tail tucked up under his legs in one of the worst neighborhoods on Chicago's West Side.

He was pawing at the door of the fire house trying to get inside and away from the scary sounds of all the fireworks. Boss was uninterested in turkey and only wanted to get in the car and drink some water. This poor guy was so stressed and dehydrated. He had no tags and no microchip. The 11th District Police Station graciously housed him for the night and gave him food and water. In the morning, he hung out with the watch secretary, whom he covered in hair by trying to crawl into her lap while she worked.

Boss is understandably a little nervous with his new surroundings but seeks affection and likes meeting new people. He will rub on you like a cat, put his head in your lap, or give you his paw if you should decide to stop petting him. He's currently in boarding but we would love to place him in a foster home with someone experienced with this majestic breed. He's now micro-chipped and up to date on his vaccines and will be neutered soon.

It appears that Boss was an outside dog. He had some superficial wounds on his face and hasn't been brushed in who knows how long. Please share Boss so that we can show him what it's like to be cared for.

Blue was found by the Chicago Police Department living in a park on the West Side of Chicago. His "owners" dumped him there one day and came back the next to take of his collar and tags when they realized they had left them on him. 

The neighborhood kids were feeding him and taking care of him when CPD found him. CPD tried to find a home through various rescues, but unfortunately ended up taking him to CACC. Luckily, K94Keeps was able to save him on August 26th! We are so happy to welcome him to the family because he is truly the sweetest soul you'll ever meet. He has deep, soulful eyes, and a big, fat awesome head.

What we discovered, though, was that he has a horribly injured ACL. It looks like it is a pretty chronic injury, as his muscle has started to deteriorate, and he doesn't really use that leg at all. Blue will definitely need surgery, and any surgery is not cheap. 

Please consider donating to Blue and his surgery! He deserves better than he has gotten. Let's show him that humans are kind and not cruel.

Uno is our special little lady. She is approximately 14 months old. She was surrendered by her owners who no longer had anywhere to live. She lived with 5 children ages 2, 8, 11, 13, and 14, so being in CACC was very scary for her. She did not do well in the shelter and got very sick. She is in ISO for the next few weeks, but soon she will be ready for a foster or forever home!

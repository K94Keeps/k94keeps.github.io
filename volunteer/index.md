K9 4 KEEPS is a 100% volunteer run, non-profit organization based in Chicago. Some dogs have had a 
“ruff” start to their lives, and that is where we jump in. You can help give these dogs a better future by volunteering
with us. If you have 1 hour a week to volunteer or 20, your help will make a difference in each of our dogs’ lives.

We are looking for volunteers to help with:

 * dog walking
 * fostering
 * dog transporting
 * home visiting
 * administrative work
 * copy and grant writing
 * pet photography
 * public relations
 * event planning & coordinating for fundraising and adoption events
 * foster and adoption counseling
 * foster and adoption coordinating
 * training
 * community outreach...and more!

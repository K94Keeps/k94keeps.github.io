K9 4 KEEPS is a 100% volunteer run, non-profit organization based in Chicago. Some dogs have had a 
“ruff” start to their lives, and that is where we jump in. You can help give these dogs a better future by volunteering
with us. If you have 1 hour a week to volunteer or 20, your help will make a difference in each of our dogs’ lives.

We are looking for volunteers to help with:

 * fostering
 * dog transporting
 * administrative work
 * copy and grant writing
 * pet photography
 * public relations
 * community outreach
 * ... and more!

If you'd like to help out, please fill out the [volunteer application](/volunteer/volunteer-application) or the [foster application](/volunteer/foster-application).

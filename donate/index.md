K9 4 KEEPS is funded 100% by your generous donations. Your gift ensures that we can continue helping dogs in need. When we bring a dog into our organization, the first step is to make sure the dog gets all of its medical needs met. Some dogs are healthy and need only the basics (spay/neuter, shots, microchip, heartworm test), and other dogs may require intensive tests, surgeries, ongoing treatment or after care. The next step is to provide the necessities for them: food, medication, housing, training, etc. All of this is costly but necessary in helping these dogs in achieving the better life that they deserve.
